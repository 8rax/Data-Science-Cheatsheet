# Data Science Cheatsheet 2.0

A helpful 4-page data science cheatsheet to assist with exam reviews, interview prep, and anything in-between. This resource is not meant to be a comprehensive deep dive into any specific model, but rather a quick refresher on a few of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms. The reader should have at least a basic understanding of statistics and linear algebra, though beginners may find this cheatsheet helpful as well. 

Inspired by Maverick's *Data Science Cheatsheet* (hence the 2.0 in the name), located [here](https://github.com/ml874/Data-Science-Cheatsheet).

### Why is Python/SQL not covered in this cheatsheet?
I planned for this resource to cover mainly algorithms, models, and concepts, as these rarely change and are common throughout industries. Technical languages and data structures often vary by job function, and I think refreshing these skills makes more sense on keyboard than on paper.
